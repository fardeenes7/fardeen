## Description

AOSP is a project by google that enables developers to build their own custom flavor of android operating system.

### My Flavour

I have built a custom android operating system for my personal use. It is based on Android 10 Pie and is called FOS. It is a minimal operating system with no google apps and services. It is built for privacy and security.

### My Code

I lost the code for my custom android operating system while switching laptop and never got around to uploading it to github. I will be building a new custom android operating system in the future and will upload the code here.
